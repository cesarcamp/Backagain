1.- Give an example of a tough goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.

Goal: Graduating as a data analyst.
Before joining Ironhack I had never written a single line of code before, I was even rejected when attempting to join, so graduating from Ironhack required lots of persistence, self-motivation, continuous and fast-paced self-learning.
I learned how to deal with frustration, how passion and persistence can help you achieve great things, and through the process, I became more disciplined as well. 

2.- Give an example of a goal you didn't meet and how you handled it.

Goal: Be the Highroller in the office
When working in Sales at Alinta in Australia I had this goal of becoming the best salesperson within the office in terms of numbers(sales), I realized that I had a few challenges in front of me such as never selling before and
the fact that all of the other guys at the office were native English speakers. The first couple of weeks I performed badly but through correct mentorship, I was able to overcome, and in the third week I was able to position myself within the top 5 in a group of +30. I was never able to reach the 1st position 
but I learned that by approaching the correct people, looking for advice, and accepting that there is still a lot to learn you can achieve great things. Patience and persistence can be your best friends.

3.- Give an example of a time where you used logic to solve a problem.

During my last project at Ironhack, I was developing a model to predict the sentiment of the main banking institutions in Mexico but I found out that there is no model trained to predict the sentiment 
in Spanish so I had to figure out a way to train one model, which my logic said that If I was able to find a dataset of tweets previously polarized in the Spanish language I would be able to train my model for my purposes.
